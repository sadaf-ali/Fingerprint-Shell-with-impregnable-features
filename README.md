# Fingerprint-Shell-with-impregnable-features
Authentication based on utilization of fingerprint has become highly popular. Generally, minutiae points information obtained from the fingerprints is stored into the database. Various research works depict that by utilizing minutiae points information, original fingerprints reconstruction is possible. Adversary can obtain the user template through an attack on the database. If minutiae template of a user is compromised, then the adversary can construct original fingerprint of the user. In order to avoid this, it is essential to secure the fingerprint information. To achieve this, a technique called 3-Dimensional Secured Fingerprint Shell has been presented by Ali and Prakash, in this technique they generate a 3-dimensional spiral curve, however, ridge counts between singular and minutiae points are not secure in this technique. In the proposed technique we construct an extremely secure and efficient template for a user, by securing all features of the fingerprint used for template generation. The proposed technique is robust against the effects of rotation as well as translation and meets the essential requirements of an efficient authentication system. We evaluated the proposed technique by utilizing FVC2000, FVC2002, FVC2004, and IIT Kanpur fingerprint databases. The results obtained for the proposed technique are highly encouraging, that shows its robustness.
